## What was the brief?

In this course assignment, we were given the task of developing The Community Science Museum, an interactive museum witch target audience is primary and middle school children (ages 7-15) and families with young children. The museum wanted an informative, appealing website to attract middle school pupils and their parents. The website should appeal to youngsters without pandering; it should take for granted that the audience is curious and intelligent. The website should be informative and engaging, encouraging viewers to visit the museum. The website should be responsive and easy to use on various devices.

There were several requirements to be met - from project methodology, research, analysis, design and prototyping of the project, to developing it in HTML and CSS, testing, debugging and deploying.

## What was my experience and what to do next time?

Throughout the process, I felt mastery as many times as I felt lost. It was a really long rollercoaster. I had some contrast issues along the way, especially with the orange colors, not complied with the WCAG standard. Figuring out when to use grid and flexbox, and how to write my nav, was also challenging - when at the same time already thinking about this in earlier stages of prototyping.

Although much seemed overwhelming at first, I was extremely happy for Trello and GitHub. The tools gave me the calm I needed and gave me a good overview of the projects process right from the start. It surprised me, that the first thing I felt doing was to “set the stage” for the project, by initializing files and folders, setting up the repository on GitHub and deploy to Netlify. I will for sure continue doing this, in my coming assignments.

I loved the whole process, with all the different stages. It gave me a lot of variation in the day to day workflow. What I am most proud of, are the mobile navigation and logo. I am also proud of how I handled the coding, which I have been insecure.

It was a challenge getting here, but it was worth all the effort! And i loved it!
